    <div><p>the next few years (Weinstein, 2000). On the other hand, Internet usage will
spread even further. It is expected that one billion people around the world will
be connected to the Internet by 2005 (Stone, 2000). As the number and type
of organizations engaged in Internet-based instruction rises, competition
among e-learning providers is likely to increase. Traditional universities are
therefore no longer indifferent to the push of new technologies and confront
        the challenge of redefining their strategies in the 21st century.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question for institutions involved in higher and distance
education is how to respond to this challenge. The answer requires the
resolution of a number of academic, administrative and technical issues. This
chapter explores these issues through the various phases involved in the

development of an Internet-based distance education system, from its incep-
tion and planning to its implementation and maintenance. There are several

options at each phase, and various institutions have opted for different courses
of action. The next section covers some of the models adopted by traditional
universities and nontraditional providers of education.<br><br></p></div>
    <center><h2><b>MODELS FOR DISTANCE EDUCATION<br>
THROUGH THE INTERNET</b></h2></center>
<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of established higher education institutions have responded to
the challenge of new technologies by establishing their “virtual” campuses as
extensions to their traditional settings. Washington State’s Web University,

Penn State’s World Campus, the University of California-Berkeley Exten-
sion Online are only some examples of this approach. A majority of these

universities have a long past in distance education through more conventional
media. Appendix A presents a sample list of traditional universities with
virtual campus extensions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these traditional universities, two different strategies can be
distinguished for producing and delivering online instruction. While some

universities develop their own software tools and class management plat-
forms, others turn to application service providers for establishing their

virtual campuses. The first strategy involves high investment costs. However,

it allows flexibility and customization to the institution’s specific require-
ments. Indiana University developed its own course management system

called OnCourse. Similarly, the University of British Columbia developed
WebCT, for preparing and delivering its online courses. WebCT is now a
commercial product used by a large number of institutions. The University of
Illinois has built several authoring and teaching systems like Mallard,
    CyberProf and NetLearning Place.</p><br></div>
<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The second strategy essentially consists of outsourcing all or part of the
establishment and operation of the university’s online learning platform to
third-party companies. There is a vast array of services offered by such

organizations, ranging from technical support to instructional design, exper-
tise for content development and/or provision, all the way to entirely hosting

and operating the instructional management system. Thus, the fixed costs of
the university turn into variable costs, but as in all outsourcing ventures, the
institution becomes dependent on the service provider. Many universities
follow this strategy, as the time to market online courses and programs is
significantly reduced. For example, Columbia University has an agreement
with Cognitive Arts, a designer and provider of e-learning technology, to
develop courses for Columbia Continuing Education Online. The courses are
provided by Columbia University, the technology is supplied by Cognitive
Arts. A sample list of e-learning platforms and service providers is presented
in Appendix B.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many universities have relationships with external entities
for purposes like funding, marketing, or just exposure through information
portals. For instance, the University of California-Berkeley, like many other

universities, has received substantial grants from the Alfred P. Sloan Foun-
dation to start online programs (Asynchronous Learning Networks, 2001).

The University of California-Berkeley Extension Online also has partner-
ships with marketing portals. These for-profit companies act as intermediar-
ies between learners and providers and allow universities to gain access to a

wide audience, without incurring up-front marketing costs. Education provid-
ers are represented on their portals, often in exchange for a commission per

enrollment. Universities can also use pure information portals like Peterson’s

Distance Learning Channel and the World Lecture Hall, for passive market-
ing and exposure to learners. A sample list of marketing/information portals

can be found in Appendix C.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Another model is for traditional universities to establish their own for-
profit subsidiaries. This is illustrated by Cornell University’s for-profit

corporation, eCornell. eCornell produces, markets and delivers non-degree
programs developed by faculty from the university’s schools and colleges.

Temple University and New York University have also launched their for-
profit subsidiaries to market courses on the Internet. In contrast, on April 4,

2001, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced its
OpenCourseWare (MITOCW) project to make almost all of its courses
accessible free of charge on the World Wide Web. More than 500 MIT courses
will be available on the Web within two years (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, 2001).</p></div><br>
<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the spectrum, for-profit universities also establish

their virtual extensions. The University of Phoenix, owned by Apollo Com-
puters, is one of the largest for-profit universities in the U.S. The University

of Phoenix Online was established as an extension to resident instruction, and
has been experiencing a steady yearly growth rate of 50% in its online course

enrollments. Park University’s Distance Education extension has been expe-
riencing a similar growth in online enrollments. Its degree completion

programs have been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges
and Schools Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the nontraditional side, there are nonprofit “virtual” universities like
Western Governors University (WGU) and the Kentucky Commonwealth
Virtual University (KCVU), that act as brokers for distance education
programs available through traditional colleges and universities. WGU
essentially facilitates student enrollment to courses delivered by around 40
post-secondary institutions. The model is based on guiding students about
what is required to gain specific competencies and where to obtain them. Once
students complete these requirements, they are assessed by WGU and obtain
their competency-based certification degrees from WGU. Thus, through
advising services and final assessment, WGU grants its own degrees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Western Governors University, the Kentucky Commonwealth
Virtual University does not award its own degrees or certificates. The model
is based on outsourcing all programs and faculty from other colleges and
universities. KCVU is managed by the Kentucky Council on Post-secondary
Education, and is founded on a network of partnerships with traditional
education providers, technology infrastructure and instructional management
system providers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way, The European Network University (TNU), a network
of European and non-European universities, nonacademic institutions and
nongovernmental organizations, does not grant academic credit itself, but
offers courses that lead to a degree from participating universities. TNU is
rooted at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still another approach is illustrated by one of the largest suppliers of
online continuing education in the U.S., OnlineLearning.net.
OnlineLearning.net offers its own courses and certification programs, but
also has partnerships with universities, marketing their accredited courses and
programs. The company provides online faculty development programs and
aids course development. It holds the exclusive worldwide electronic rights
to online courses from the University of California-Los Angeles Extension,
and offers courses from the University of San Diego, among others. All such
courses earn academic credit.</p></div><br><br>
<div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, a number of companies have established their own

virtual universities. Kaplan, Inc., an educational subsidiary of the Wash-
ington Post Company, founded the Concord University School of Law in

1998. Concord has its own full-time faculty and a number of visiting and
supplementary lecturers. UNext founded Cardean University. Courses at
Cardean are prepared by faculty from leading universities like Carnegie
Mellon, Columbia, Stanford and the London School of Economics and

Political Science, and are delivered by UNext adjunct professors. Corpo-
rate universities like Dell Learning, by Dell Computer Corp., and SunU,

run by Sun Microsystems Inc., also cooperate with academic institutions
to deliver online courses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones International University (JIU) is an example for a not-for profit
virtual university founded by a for-profit company. Established in 1993, JIU
is the first fully accredited online institution of higher education. The model
used at JIU involves “content experts” and “teaching faculty.” Courses are
designed and developed by “content experts” and delivered by “teaching
faculty.” Content experts are faculty from leading universities, including the
University of California-Berkeley, Rutgers, Columbia, Purdue, Stanford and
the University of Texas at Austin. Faculty facilitate the online instruction of
these courses. A sample list of virtual universities is provided in Appendix D.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Other approaches include alliances between universities, and partner-
ships between universities and companies in telecommunications and pub-
lishing to exploit the power of new systems and technologies. In 1999, some

of the largest research universities in the U.S. and Canada joined forces to
market distance education courses through a central repository on the Web.
The website, R1.edu, is maintained by the University of Washington. Hong
Kong Polytechnic University has partnered with Pacific Century Cyberworks,
a telecommunications products and services company, to create Hong Kong
Cyber University. Pearson, the world’s largest education publisher is rapidly
expanding its share of the online education market. The company has
alliances with universities and partnerships with solution providers like
Blackboard and WebCT to supply a variety of online learning services
(Blumenstyk, 2000). Similarly, Houghton Mifflin Company, a publisher of
textbooks and other educational materials and technologies, has a strategic
partnership with OnlineLearning.net.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Many institutions across the world are leveraging distance and continu-
ing education through the Internet. NKI, one of the largest nongovernmental

education institutions in Scandinavia, was the first European online college
and has been providing online education for the past 15 years (Paulsen &
Rekkedal, 2001). Last year, the British government announced its University</p></div><br>
<div><p>for Industry (UFI) project. UFI is intended to be a vocational school that will
offer most of its programs online (Walker, 2000). UNESCO’s recent initiative
to create an e-learning portal illustrates the thrust to facilitate access to
education resources on a global scale. Open universities like the Open
University U.K. and Athabasca University in Canada are also adopting the
online mode of delivery to increase their outreach.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional universities in different parts of the world are integrating
Internet-based learning into their conventional structures. The University of
South Australia and Deakin University (Australia) have undertaken major
projects to convert courses and programs to the online mode. Similarly,
Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey has developed an
institutional e-learning system for both on-campus and off-campus students.
The next section summarizes the METU experience.</p>
<center><h2><b>THE METU E-LEARNING INITIATIVE</b></h2></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle East Technical University was the first, among 71 universities in

Turkey, to implement an Internet-based learning environment: METU-
Online. One of the leading universities in Turkey, METU has over 20,000

students enrolled in graduate and undergraduate programs offered by 39
departments in five facilities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The university has taken a centralized institutional approach for the
initiation of Internet-based learning. This allowed the consolidation of scarce

resources and facilitated the coordination of activities. The task of establish-
ing METU-Online was given to the university’s Informatics Institute. The

Institute is an interdisciplinary graduate school, offering degrees in areas
where the theory and practice of a number of disciplines merge. Currently, the
Institute has three programs: Cognitive Science, Information Systems, and
Modeling and Simulation. The Cognitive Science program focuses on the
cognitive aspects of computational approaches to speech and language
analysis, teaching, and creative uses of computers in an information society.

It amalgamates the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, linguis-
tics, psychology, cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. The Information

Systems program integrates business administration, computer engineering,

electrical and electronics engineering, and industrial engineering. The Mod-
eling and Simulation program concentrates on the theoretical and practical

aspects of modeling, virtual environments and computer simulation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its foundation in 1996, the Institute has conducted several research
projects on asynchronous learning. Thus, the responsibility for all planning,
development and implementation activities concerning distance education
through the Internet at METU was assigned to the Informatics Institute.</p></div>
